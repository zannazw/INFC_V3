This C program demonstrates basic display control using an ATmega328P microcontroller. The display is set to 16-bit color, with the entire screen in yellow and a green 15x20 pixel rectangle positioned at (35, 90) in portrait mode. Input handling is implemented for Button1 and Button2, with debouncing managed through a 1ms Timer/Counter0 interrupt. Button 1 moves the rectangle one pixel left, and Button 2 moves it one pixel right, with smooth, continuous movement when held. The rectangle stays within the screen boundaries, ensuring it doesn't move beyond the edges.
